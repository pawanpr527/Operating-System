# ***🖥️ Classic OS Synchronization & Deadlock Algorithms (Python)***

Welcome to this repository 🎉
It contains Python implementations of fundamental Operating System problems related to synchronization, deadlocks, and concurrency control.
These are classic problems studied in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, and Parallel Computing courses.

📂 Implemented Problems
1. 🍽 Dining Philosopher Problem -

🔹 Synchronization using threads and locks
🔹 Prevents deadlock & starvation when philosophers compete for forks

2. 🏦 Banker’s Algorithm —
   
🔹 Implements deadlock avoidance strategy
🔹 Ensures the system is always in a safe state before allocating resources

4. 🔄 Peterson’s Solution —

🔹 Classic software-based mutual exclusion algorithm
🔹 Demonstrates critical section handling between two processes (threads in Python)

4. 🏭 Producer-Consumer Problem — 

🔹 Models the bounded buffer problem
🔹 Uses threading + Queue/Semaphores to synchronize producer(s) and consumer(s)

5. 📚 Reader-Writer Problem — 

🔹 Demonstrates synchronization between multiple readers and writers
✔ Multiple readers can access concurrently
✔ Writers get exclusive access

🧠 Concepts Covered

✅ Mutual Exclusion (Locks, Peterson’s Algorithm)
✅ Synchronization (Semaphores, Queues, Threading)
✅ Deadlock Avoidance (Banker’s Algorithm)
✅ Inter-Process / Thread Communication
✅ Concurrency in Operating Systems
